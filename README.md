# wd_sprint3_war
This is a public repository to code a card game War (Turing College's Web Development program)

## REQUIREMENTS

1) Project should be based on OOP paradigm.

2) At the start of each game, a deck of cards needs to be created, shuffled and split equally between all players

    suits = Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs

    ranks = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace

    The above could be done by an object of class Dealer?

3) Each player should be an object of class Player

    number of objects: 2 (maybe allow user to create more?)

4) Game loop:

    a) Each player plays a face-up card (battle)

    b) Whoever has a higher rank wins and adds cards to their deck (at the bottom)

    c) If the ranks are the same, initiate "war":

    d) Each player plays a face-down card

    e) Each player plays a face-up card (same as a)

    f) If player has no deck, they are eliminated
